  <p>The police made sure that the Aficans followed the a Apartheid laws.<br> 
  The black were not allowed to have any relationships with the whites. Anyone found breaking that law was arrested. The blacks were also not allowed to live in the flats allocated for the whites.<br>The blacks who rented the flats that belonged to the whites had to pretend to be  maids for hem not to be arrested. Most of the blacks lived in the slums.<br>
  The police encouraged racism<br>
  The whites tried to overpower anyone that wasn't like them by using police manipulation.<br>
  If the police saw any Asian sitting on the whites only-bench, the police would command them to get off the bench that belonged to the whites and if the person would say that he is a Japanese, the police would let them stay. Japanese were considered whites because the government wanted to import Japanese cars.

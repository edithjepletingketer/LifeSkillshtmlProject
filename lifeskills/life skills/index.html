<h1>THE ROLE AND TREATMENT OF WOMEN IN HOMEGOING</h1>


<p>Marriage was important to women. The bride price brought wealth to the family.<br>
Adwoa was married to a British soldier who paid fifteen pounds for bride price.<br>
 James Collins marries Effia and pays bride price more than any previous bride prize in the village.
</p>

<p>
Women sole purpose is to have children. When Abeeku tells Baabe to let him know when Effia is ready.<br> He was implying her maturity period. Effia was despised because the people in the village thought she was cursed and barren.<br>
</p>

<p>
Some women were sexually violated. Maame was raped by Coobe when she was working as a maid at his house.<br>
 Esi is also sexually violated by the British man. She is taken from the dungeon and the man rapes her.
</p>

<p>
The circle of beatings demonstrates how women experience violence in the hands of men.<br> Baabe was always beaten by Coobe whenever she mistreated Effia. Esi is also mistreated by her master.<br> The master gave Esi five lashes for every Twi Ness spoke and when Ness was quiet he also gave her five lashes for Ness’ silence.<br>
</p>

<p>
The role of the women was to teach their children how to behave. Ness found hard to smile because she was raised by unsmiling mum.<br> Baabe wanted Effia to be quiet whenever they were visited by chief Abeeku. She was also told never to tell anyone about her periods.<br> Esi was taught by her mum to respect little dove.

<p>
In <span>Kenya</span> women still battle for equality, majority of the elected leaders are men and the third gender rule hasn’t been fully implemented.
</p>
<p>
In some communities like the Maasai and some Kalenjins still practice FGM and early marriages on young girls hence shuttering their dreams.
</p>
<p>
Women roles are to do all the household chores the baby sitting. Some women work and manage their homes. The houseld chores should never be associated with a specific gender. 
</p>
<p class="centre_content">
Most ladies are advised to venture to certain careers because they are underestimated on doing men related jobs.<br>
 Examples of the jobs that are assumed to be for men are engineering and technology. Some women have empowered themselves in the field of technology and they have prospered proving that women can do any job that  is assumed to be for men.</p>
